# Frameworks SDK Module Build Scripts

We have build scripts for compiling the Frameworks SDK using system available
modules and libraries.

## Build Environment

The build environment assumes a user session on
`{aurora,sunspot}.alcf.anl.gov`. Builds are performed in `/tmp`.

Prior to building, most build scripts will load common modules and environment
variables using the `setup_build_env` routine in `ci-lib.sh`.

### Manual Usage
If not running the CI pipeline, the Framework SDK build scripts can be
configured via the following environment variables.

| Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FRAMEWORKS_ROOT_DIR` | Directory to store built artifacts | `/lus/flare/projects/datascience/frameworks-ci` (Lustre allocation on Aurora) |
| `FRAMEWORKS_PYTHON_VERSION` | Python version to build against | `3.12` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_TORCH_VERSION` | PyTorch version to build (`git` ref) | `v2.10.0` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_TRITON_VERSION` | Triton-XPU version to build (`git` ref) | `main` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_TORCHCCL_VERSION` | torchCCL version to build (`git` ref) | `master` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_IPEX_VERSION` | IPEX version to build (`git` ref) | `xpu-main` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_VLLM_VERSION` | vLLM version to build (`git` ref) | `main` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_VLLM_XPU_KERNELS_VERSION` | vLLM XPU kernels version to build (`git` ref) | `main` |
| `FRAMEWORKS_SDK_TESTS_VERSION` | Frameworks SDK validation tests version (`git` ref) | `main` |

Then, run any of the scripts in `nightly_wheels`. The resultant builds/logs
will then be in `$FRAMEWORKS_ROOT_DIR/$(whoami)`.

## Adding a Build Script

Build scripts are generally structured similarly.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

source "$(dirname "$(realpath "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")/../ci-lib.sh"

# 1) Pull source and gen build environment
gen_build_dir_with_git 'https://github.com/<foo>/<bar>'
setup_build_env

setup_uv_venv # pass needed dependencies (i.e. from prior builds) here

# 2) Set <library> configuration
CC="$(which gcc)"
export CC
CXX="$(which g++)"
export CXX

# 3) Build & Archive
build_bdist_wheel
artifact_out "<bar>-*.whl"
```

## Testing

The `test` stage of the CI pipeline runs a
[`bats`](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) harness (see `tests/`).
Components are tested against an ephemeral `uv` venv of the wheels built by
the pipeline.

Additionally, the
[frameworks-sdk-tests](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/frameworks-sdk-tests)
validation suite is cloned at test time and its default `smoke` suite runs
against the built wheels. Its `summary.json` results are converted to JUnit
XML (`tools/frameworks-sdk-tests-junit.py`) and ingested by GitLab CI, so
individual validation test results show up in the pipeline test report. On
`aurora.alcf.anl.gov`, it can be run manually via:

```sh
./tests/bats/bin/bats tests/frameworks-sdk-tests.bats
```

## Wheels

We have scripts to build the following wheels:
- pytorch/
    - pytorch
    - ao[^disabled]
    - torchtune[^disabled]
- intel/
    - intel-extension-for-pytorch
    - torch-ccl
    - intel-xpu-backend-for-triton
- vllm-project/
    - vllm
    - vllm-xpu-kernels
- mpi4py/mpi4py
- h5py/h5py[^disabled]

[^disabled]: not ran by CI pipeline
